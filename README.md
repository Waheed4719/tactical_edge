Welcome to Tactical Edge Assignment! This repository contains the source code for our application. Below, you will find information on how to get started, as well as screenshots and descriptions of our login/register page and movie list with pagination. We have also included instructions on how to add/edit movie screenshots and details on our API documentation using Swagger. Lastly, we have containerized our application using Docker.

## Login/Register Page

With our application, users have the ability to add and edit movie details. This feature allows users to contribute to the movie database and keep it up to date. The screenshots above demonstrate the user-friendly interface for adding and editing movie information.

## API Documentation with Swagger

We have integrated Swagger into our application to provide comprehensive API documentation. Swagger allows developers to explore and test our API endpoints, making it easier to understand and integrate with our application. The API documentation provides detailed information on each endpoint, including request and response examples.

## Containerization with Docker

We have containerized our application using Docker. This allows for easy deployment and scalability, as Docker provides a consistent and isolated environment for running our application. With Docker, you can quickly set up and run our application on any platform that supports Docker.

## Tech Stack

Tactical Edge is built using the following technologies:

- Frontend/Backend: Next.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Containerization: Docker / Docker-Compose

The combination of Next.js and MongoDB allows us to create a robust and scalable application. Next.js provides a modern and efficient framework for building both the frontend and backend, while MongoDB serves as the database for storing movie information.
